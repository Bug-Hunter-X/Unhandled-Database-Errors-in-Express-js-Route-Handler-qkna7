# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers that interact with databases.

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route handler that fetches user data from a database.  It lacks proper error handling, potentially resulting in a 500 Internal Server Error with a vague message, or even a complete application crash if the error isn't caught.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.
